# nfectionary

NFECTIONARY is a tool that allows users to get some insights into infection rates of some of the more common diseases in their state. Users can see where their state ranks against other states in current case counts. Is Florida having higher than normal reported cases of Influenza? Maybe we shouldn't go there for our vacation with Grandma. It also provides users with imformation about each disease, transmission, prevention, detection, etc. The data is gathered from the CDC website.
